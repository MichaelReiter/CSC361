'''
For each TCP connection, your program needs to provide the following
statistical results for the whole trace data:
- the number of reset TCP connections observed in the trace
- the number of TCP connections that were still open when the trace capture ended
- the number of complete TCP connections observed in the trace

Regarding the complete TCP connections you observed:
- the minimum, mean, and maximum time durations of the complete TCP connections
– the minimum, mean, and maximum RTT (Round Trip Time) values of the complete TCP connections
– the minimum, mean, and maximum number of packets (both directions) sent on the complete TCP connections
– the minimum, mean, and maximum receive window sizes (both sides) of the complete TCP connections.
